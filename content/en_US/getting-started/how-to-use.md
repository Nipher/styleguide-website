The Styleguide is completely modular. This means two things:

- Content is separated from code
- Code is split in independent modules

With this in mind, we recommend you to learn how to use the system before moving on to building your project's styleguide.

##### _data.json files
- In these files are all the textual content and configurations. 
- There's one in the styleguide folder and one inside each module.

##### Generated files
- In the assets/scripts folder a file will be generated if you want to import all of your modules Javascript into your project.
- In the assets/styles folder a file will be generated if you want to import all of your modules Stylesheet into your project.
