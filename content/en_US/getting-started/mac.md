For Mac users we have an installer with all necessary dependencies to get the Styleguide working.

- The 'Start' app, will install everything you need. Please check the [Known Issues](#know-issues) section before running this app. When it's finished the Styleguide will open automaticaly in you browser. If you already have all the dependencies installed in your computer, the Styleguide will open.

- The 'Compile' app creates a static version of the Styleguide in a 'www' folder.
